## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, Iâ€™m Deivanai Anandhâ€”a student at VIT Chennai majoring in Electronics and Computer Science Engineering, with a focus on Data Science. Iâ€™m passionate about the intersection of electronics and computing, and love exploring how data empowers innovation in AI, machine learning, and smart device technology. 

At VIT, Iâ€™m committed to building a solid foundation in both fields and applying analytical thinking to solve real-world problems. I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy contributing to impactful projects that bridge hardware and intelligent software. 

Iâ€™m especially interested in how data-driven approaches can make devices smarter and more adaptive, whether thatâ€™s through embedded systems, machine learning models, or creative tech solutions.  If youâ€™re working at the intersection of electronics and computingâ€”especially involving AI, ML, or cutting-edge embedded systemsâ€”Iâ€™d be excited to learn from you. Iâ€™m always looking to grow, tackle new challenges, and contribute fresh ideas.

Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn! Letâ€™s learn and build the future of tech together.
